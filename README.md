# Hi there! 👋

I'm Tamjid Hossen, a tech enthusiast currently surviving—*I mean*, studying—Computer Science & Engineering. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

- 🌱 Currently juggling and exploring:
  - Competitive Programming & DSA (yes, I willingly do this)
  - LLMs, AI, and Automation (letting machines do my work, responsibly)
  - Web development technologies  
    - Check out my “totally desktop-only” portfolio: **tamjidhossen.me**  
      (Mobile users… good luck. I am lazy so blame the agent.)

Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out if you want to connect, collaborate, or just stare at code together.

Thanks for visiting. 😊
